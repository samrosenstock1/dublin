            <h3>Irish Parliament & Museums</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-13">May 13, 2024</time>

            <p>Today I had an amazing time on my exclusive trip to the Irish Parliament. Here, I got to see the historic building that was built in 1729. I got to learn a lot about Irish history as well as how their government works. It was amazing to see that the most secure building in all of Ireland had no guns and very little security - unlike America. Also, I visited two museums and saw many interesting fossils. I went to The National Museum of Ireland and the Natural History Museum of Ireland.</p>

            <h3>The Portal and The Zoo</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 9, 2024</time>

            <p>Today I had an adventurous day and got to explore many different things! To start, I got to visit the Dublin / New York City Portal. This was amazing as I am from New York City and it is a major coincidence that the first ever portal was open up between New York and Dublin when I visited Dublin for the first time. My favorite part is watching the way people interact with each other, and I even saw someone I know on the portal! Also, I went to the zoo today. This was an amazing experience as the zoo was equivalent to a 3 mile walk! My favorite part by far were the monkeys. It was amazing to see how they interacted with each other. Lastly, as a bonus - I got to see a cricket game when I left the zoo. The field was extremely scenic and had very beautiful grass. Also, the people were really friendly and explained how the game works and why the all wear white outfits.</p>

            <h3>Guinness Factory: A tour & tasting experience</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-08">May 8, 2024</time>
        </label>
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Today I went to the Guinness Factory and learned many interesting facts. Guinness is made from only 4 ingredients: water, barley, hops, and yeast. Guinness gets its dark color by being roasted to 232 degrees Celsius. Guinness is only made in Dublin, and the reason it does not taste as good in other countries is not due to the traveling. Actually, Guinness travels really well, but once the Keg is opened - then it does not last as long. Therefore, the reason Ireland has the best Guinness is because people drink it more here, so each Keg is used in a quicker period of time - making the Guinness better. There are also more fun facts such as: Guinness is supposed to be at 5-7 degrees Celsius, the tube from the Keg to where it is poured should be at least 6 feet long, and there are many more!</p>

            <h3>Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024</time>
        </label>
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Today I saw many things, ranging from the most infamous murder of all of Europe to the best Guinness in Ireland! I started off the day with an amazing brunch. Next, I took a tour of the city from a tour guide who had so much information in his back pocket. I learned about the city's culture and history leading up to current day, and learned about the story behind the Spire of Dublin. Afterwards, I drank my first Irish Guinness at Lord Edwards and was very impressed. I finished off the night with a great Chinese Restaurant.</p>
