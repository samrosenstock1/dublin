        <h2>About Cliffs of Moher</h2>
        <p>The cliffs were an amazing sight. It was amazing to me that at certain points - I could not even hear the waves crashing as we were so high up. The cliffs go up to 700 feet and it was incredbile how beautiful they were.
            Everyone was enjoying themselves there and was taking in the views. Looking down, you see how clear the water is and all of the seagulls by the water, and they all circled the most beautiful natural rock I have ever seen.
        </p>
        <p>My favorite part may have actually been the animals. In the opposite direction of the water - right behind the path - there was a farm. What was so amazing was that these animals were right next to us. It was even better
            than the zoo that you actually have to pay for. These cows were right next to us behind the most beautiful landscape. It was nice to see that everyone respected the animals and did not bother them.
