        <h2>About Galway</h2>
        <p>Galway was one of the most unique cities I have ever been to. To start, I visited the Computers and Communications Museum of Ireland.
            Here, I got to play with so many different devices. I was amazed that every old device was full functional - including the first Macintosh, the first iPhone, and much more.
            Also, I had an amazing time seein how electricity and radio waves travel. 
        </p>
        <p>The city had a bunch of historical culture - including a castly from the 1200s. One takeaway I had was that there were way more tourists than I expected in this city. Also, the city had a great culture with a bunch of amazing pubs all crowded on one street. It was nice to see that everything stayed open late - and everyone seemed to enjoy the city.
            After trying all of the pubs, I got to try my first Spice Bag to end the night.
