        <h2>About Dublin</h2>
        <p>Dublin is a city with plenty of history engrained in the city. My first image below shows the Thomas Moore Statue. This statue was after Moore died and was funded by public subscription.
            The statue was built by Ellington. My next image shows the cross representing the the most infamous murder in Irish history. It has flowers on it as our tour happened to have been on the 
            anniversary of the death. This death was towards a newly elected official and caused a major reaction across all of Europe. Another image image I have shows the Spire of Dublin - which many Irish people find ugly.
            The last image on the first row is the Parliament Building - which I was lucky to get an amazing tour.
        </p>
        <p>On the second row, I am showing the first ever apartments in Dublin. These represent the recent boom of the city - going from anctient to a tech hub. Next, image shows bullet holes on a building that is in the middle of the city.
            This really shows how the long history of Ireland is engrained into current architecture. The next image is where the President lives. The President is does not have much power here, and it was interesting to me that there was essentially
            no security unlike the United States. Also, this building inspired the White House. Lastly, this Guinness was my favorite of the entire trip. This was in the Storehouse - which is a major part of Dublin and Ireland as Guinness fuels the economy.
